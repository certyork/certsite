    <h2 class="title"> Why choose CERT for an evaluation or research project</h2>
    <p>
      The Converge Evaluation and Research Team is a group of researchers with lived
      experience of mental health difficulties based at York St John University.
      Within our group there are members with considerable academic research experience, and
      members have received university level training in a variety of research methods. Our
      mission is to listen to people with mental health issues to influence service provision
      through research and evaluation. <a>Click to read more about our mission and values.</a><br><br>
      Alongside university academics, we are able to offer bespoke evaluation of your mental
      health service or community project. We are proficient in using research techniques
      including interviews, questionnaires, focus groups and more creative approaches such as
      art work, photography and creative writing to answer your questions. <a>Click here to read our reports and academic publications.</a><br><br>
      Developing and using inventive approaches, we specialise in finding ways to support people
      who find it hard to express themselves to take part in evaluations. Where possible, we
      strive to involve your service users in our research and evaluation process.
      In addition to producing a professional evaluation report focused on the outcomes most
      important to you, we are also able to offer creative methods of disseminating our findings,
      such as theatre, film and art.<br><br>
      A substantial body of evidence confirms that people with lived experience of mental health
      difficulties, such as CERT, bring expertise that can enrich all aspects of the research or
      evaluation process[1,2].<br><br>

      CERT can make your evaluation or research more relevant to peopleâ€™s lives
    </p>
    <p>
      People like us with lived experience of mental health difficulties can offer valuable insights
      into the daily lives and situations of other service users. We can use these insights to help
      ensure your research or evaluation is relevant to your service users and to your service[3].
      Engaging people with lived experience in the research process is thought to lead to the
      generation of new and more in-depth knowledge, meaning you will gain a greater
      understanding of the lives of your service users[4].
      The inclusion of people with lived experience is especially crucial in the early stages where
      priorities are decided and outcome measures selected[6].<br><br>

    <p class="subtitle" style="font-weight: 600">
      CERT can help you select more relevant, innovative, and user-friendly outcome measures
    </p>
    <p>
      Service users and professionals often see the world from very different perspectives[5].
      The involvement of lived experience researchers such as CERT can lead to the development
      of more innovative and relevant outcome measures[6] which are more acceptable to service
      users[7]. Such engagement can also lead to more user-friendly ways of collecting data[8]
      and different recruitment strategies[7].<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle" style="font-weight: 600">
      CERT can encourage more open and honest responses from your participants
    </p>
    <p>
      There is considerable evidence that lived experience researchers such as CERT, get more
      open, honest and forthcoming responses during interviews[3,9,10]. For example, following
      up answers differently to non-lived experience interviewers[9].<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle" style="font-weight: 600">
      CERT can help you achieve more valid and meaningful interpretations of your data
    </p>
    <p>
      Lived experience researchers such as CERT increase the quality of the data[10] and im-
      prove the validity of the interpretation of the data[11]. Furthermore, the involvement of
      lived experience researchers in the data analysis stage can ensure your interpretations are
      consistent with service user experience[6].<br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>
      The insight we have gained through our lived experience means CERT offers a different
      and more valid approach to addressing your research question or evaluation needs.
